const INTRO_LETTER = """Dear Lea,

I was shocked and saddened to learn about the death of your
sister, Rachel. I know you were close to her and thought of
her as ‘your twin’. I imagine your grief must be overwhelming.
Please know that we are here for you.

Rachel was ambitious and relentless in her Quest to solve the
mystery of this cursed record player. Please don’t do the same,
enjoy your life and stay away from your haunted family house.
You can come stay with us until you find some place for yourself.

I will cherish the memories I have of Rachel. I remember meeting Rachel
for the first time in the garden behind your House playing hide and seek
with you and John, three unencumbered kids playing in the sun in peace,
no music to haunt them.

I wish you peace, and I’m here to support you during this difficult time.

With love,
Steven"""

const SOLUTION_LETTER1 = """Dear Rachel,

I researched the record player model and it was made
in 1966 by Lucian Morgenstern, a renowned manufacturer
of high end record players. The one you have seems to
be one of only 6 of its kind and was released on the 6th
of June with a big press release. I realy hope that this
random info can help you to stop that thing from playing.

Kind regards 
Paul Norderbeck"""

const SOLUTION_LETTER2 = """Dear Rachel,

first of all: I don't think you should try to solve the mystery 
of this cursed record player, too many members of your family got
lost in it, but if you really want to try it here are some things
from a letter your grand father max send me.

The circuits are some sort of logic puzzle, the buttons at the 
bottom will send an electric current to the logic gates above them
if pressed. The gates will send a current to the next gate if they
receive the correct input.

Cheers 
Konstantin"""

const FINAL_LETTER = """Dear Lea,

Thank you for lifting this curse off our family. I was by the house
today and I was overwhelmed by the silence and peace. For the first
time in 25 years I could sit in the living room where I grow up without
this sound of terror.

With love
Jan"""
