Dear <Player>,
I was shocked and saddened to learn about the death of your sister, Rachel. I know you were close to her and thought of her as ‘your twin’. I imagine your grief must be overwhelming. Please know that we are here for you.
Rachel was ambitious and relentless in her Quest to solve the mystery of this cursed record player. Please don’t do the same, enjoy your life and stay away from your haunted family house. You can come stay with us until you find some place for yourself.
I will cherish the memories I have of Rachel. I remember meeting Rachel for the first time in the garden behind your House playing hide and seek with you and John, three unencumbered kids playing in the sun in peace, no music to haunt them.
I wish you peace, and I’m here to support you during this difficult time.
With love,
Steven
