Dear Rachel,

I researched the record player model and it was made in 1966 by Lucian Morgenstern, a renowned manufacturer of high end record players. The one you have seems to be one of only 6 of its kind and was released on the 6th of June with a big press release. I realy hope that this random info can help you to stop that thing from playing.

Kind regards
